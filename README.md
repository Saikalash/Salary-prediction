üí∞ Salary Prediction using Machine Learning
Overview
This project implements a Machine Learning model to predict salary based on various features present in a provided dataset. The core objective is to apply data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and rigorous evaluation to build a robust predictor.The analysis heavily focuses on data visualization, showing feature distributions, correlations, and model performance through histograms, bar graphs, and scatter plots.
üöÄ Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, encodes categorical features (e.g., using One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding), and scales numerical data.Exploratory 
Data Analysis (EDA): Uses various visualizations (histograms, box plots, bar charts) to understand the distribution of salaries and the relationship between features (like education, experience, or job title) and the target variable (Salary).
Machine Learning Model: Utilizes regression techniques (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, or Gradient Boosting) for prediction.
Model Evaluation: Reports standard regression metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and $R^2$ score.
Visualization Showcase: Generates detailed charts to explain the data and the prediction process.
üìä Data & Files
The project relies on a single dataset file.Salary_Data.csv: The primary dataset used for training and testing the model. This file contains features like [List 2-3 key features, e.g., 'Years of Experience', 'Job Title', 'Education Level'] and the target variable, Salary.
üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Setup
To run this project locally, follow these steps.
Prerequisites
You need Python 3.8+ installed.
1. Clone the repository
In Bash
git clone https://github.com/Saikalash/Salary-prediction.git
cd Salary-prediction
2. Install Dependencies
Install the necessary libraries using pip and the requirements.txt file (you may need to create this file, listing pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib).Bashpip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
6. Place the Dataset
Ensure your dataset file (Salary_Data.csv) is placed in the root directory of the cloned repository.
üíª How to Run the Code
The main script handles the entire workflow from data loading to visualization and prediction.Open your terminal in the project directory.Execute the main Python script:
Bashpython
main.py
Expected Output
The script will print the model's performance metrics to the console and generate several visual files in your project directory:
salary_distribution.png (Histogram)
feature_vs_salary_barplot.png (Bar Graph)
predicted_vs_actual.png (Model Performance Plot)
